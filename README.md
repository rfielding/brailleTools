A tiny braille editor designed for braille-first.  The use of orca+brltty means that you don't have full animation control over dots.  I want:

- modal cursors, so you can be in a vim-like session and distinguish between modes
- flashing marked carriage return marker
- do not clobber current output with current input, as ed does
