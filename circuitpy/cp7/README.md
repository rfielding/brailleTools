iPhone Usable Build
===================

Install CircuitPython7 on the board. It allows you to use a boot.py file,
that is required to recognize the keyboard.  When you are plugging it in,
hold down left hand first-finger key. It lights up yellow; and /Volumes/CIRCUITPY
will show so that you can modify code on the keyboard. Right hand first
finger key is red by contrast.
